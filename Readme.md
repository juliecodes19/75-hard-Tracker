The 75 hard challenge is a mental toughness challenge that consists of a list of repetitive tasks to accomplish every day for 75 days:
1.	Stick to a specific diet
2.	Workout twice a day for 45min each time
3.	Read at least 10 pages of a non fiction book
4.	Drink at least 4L of water
5.	Take a progress picture
My MVP will help my user track his progress by inputting daily info,  send a reminder if the user didnâ€™t enter any info by a certain time, and also generate daily/weekly reports that he can share with an accountability partner.
